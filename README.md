## Supported File Formats

| Format | Instruments | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| R&S semicolon-delimited `.dat` | Rohde & Schwarz instruments | Tested |
| Amplitude-only `.dat` | R&S instruments | Frequency reconstructed from metadata |
| Touchstone `.s1p` to `.sNp` | RF network measurements | Supported for S/Y/Z trace workflows and Smith view |

---

## Known Issues

- Smith charts are currently a bit buggy in some workflows. They are complex to implement correctly, and improvements are planned for future updates.

---

## Getting Started

### Local Use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chelstein/mergen-scope.git
```

Open `kedgeiq.html` directly in a modern browser. No build step and no install.

### GitHub Pages Deployment

Push to `main`. GitHub Actions deploys automatically via `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`.

---

## Usage

### Loading a File

Click **Load File** and select a `.dat` or `.sNp` export. Use **Append** to add more traces.

### Workspace Sessions

Use **Save Workspace** to export the current session as JSON, including imported files, derived traces, pane layout, zoom state, markers, reference lines, and saved analysis results.

Use **Open Workspace** to restore a previously exported session in one step.

### Data and Chart Export

Use **Export Data** to download the current traces as JSON, including raw traces, derived traces, the current Noise PSD analysis trace when available, and saved Noise/IP3 results.

Use **PNG** or **SVG** to export the current chart view as an image.

### Markers and Peak Search

Click the chart to place a marker. Select a marker to make it active, then use **Peak**, **Next Peak**, **Min**, or **Next Min** to move it to signal features.

### Trace Ops

Open **Trace Ops** to create derived traces from existing traces:

- **Offset** adds a constant value
- **Scale** multiplies by a constant factor
- **Smoothing** supports None, Moving Average, Median Filter, and Savitzky-Golay
- **Trace Math** supports `A + B`, `A - B`, `A * B`, `A / B`

Trace Math works over the overlapping X range only, uses A's grid, and offers interpolation control for mapping trace B onto A.

Trace Math also shows short warning-only notes when logarithmic units can make the result misleading. That includes same-unit logarithmic math such as `dBm + dBm`, `dB * dB`, and mixed logarithmic-unit math such as `dB * dBm`. These notes do not block the operation and do not change the math.

### Multi-Pane

Use the **Pane** controls to switch between:

- **1 Pane** for the current single-chart workflow
- up to **4 stacked panes** for shared-X comparison with independent Y scaling

In multi-pane mode you can:

- set the active pane
- add or remove panes
- move the selected trace to any pane
- drag a trace row from the sidebar and drop it onto a pane header or pane body
- fit the current pane
- fit all panes
- clear one pane by moving its traces back to another pane

Current first-release behavior:

- X zoom and pan are shared across panes
- Y zoom and fit are pane-local
- marker search follows the active pane and its selected trace
- reference lines are pane-local by default, with an optional lock mode to place linked lines across all panes

### Noise PSD

Open the **Noise PSD** panel, set the resolution bandwidth, and the tool computes noise power spectral density from the selected trace.

### IP3 / TOI Measurement

Assign marker roles (F1, F2, IM3L, IM3U) using the marker panel, then compute IP3 from the marked points.

### Analysis

Open **Analysis** to access pane-aware numeric tools that act on the selected trace in the active pane over the currently visible range:

- **Peak / Spur Table**
- **Marker Delta Table**
- **Range Statistics**
- **3 dB / 10 dB Bandwidth**
- **Threshold Crossings**
- **Ripple / Flatness**
- **Occupied Bandwidth**
- **Channel Power** with strict unit gating
- **VSWR** (Touchstone reflection traces)
- **Return Loss** (Touchstone reflection traces)
- **Group Delay** (Touchstone traces)
- **Reciprocity / Isolation** (Touchstone transmission traces)
- **Touchstone Stability** (2-port, K / mu1 / mu2 / |delta|)

Group Delay is computed from complex S-parameter data as $\tau_g(f)=-(1/(2\pi))\,d\phi/df$ using unwrapped phase from `atan2(im,re)`, frequency in Hz, central-difference derivatives for interior points, and forward/backward differences at the edges. Very low-magnitude regions are masked to avoid unstable phase-derivative spikes.

### Touchstone Stability Analysis

For 2-port Touchstone traces, the **Touchstone Stability** card computes stability metrics over the visible range and can generate scalar traces for:

- `K`
- `mu1`
- `mu2`
- `|delta|`

The card summarizes min/max ranges, center-point values, and whether visible points satisfy unconditional stability checks (`K > 1` and `|delta| < 1`).

## Architecture

No build step. The app still runs directly in the browser from GitHub Pages using local vendored runtime files under `vendor/`.

`kedgeiq.html` is now a thin loader/bootstrap file. It mainly defines the document shell, loads the vendored browser runtime plus local `app-modules/*.js` files in order, and mounts `window.AppController.AppRoot` directly.

The app runtime is split across browser-global modules under `app-modules/`:

- `app-modules/app-hooks.js` for extracted React hooks plus helper wiring used by the controller
- `app-modules/app-shell-components.js` for shell UI pieces such as buttons, trace rows, marker/ref-line cards, top bar, and footer components
- `app-modules/app-analysis-components.js` for the analysis card/component stack used by the right-side analysis panel
- `app-modules/app-chart-components.js` for the empty-chart state and chart workspace rendering components
- `app-modules/app-controller.js` for app orchestration, derived view-model composition, and the browser-mounted `AppRoot`

The split keeps the no-build architecture intact while moving the high-churn app code out of the HTML entrypoint. The current rules are:

- keep direct file-open support
- keep GitHub Pages compatibility
- keep local plain scripts attached to `window`
- keep the browser-global module boundary stable

Current helper split:

- `app-modules/trace-helpers.js` for chart/window helpers
- `app-modules/trace-model.js` for trace identity, units, and axis-label helpers
- `app-modules/trace-ops-helpers.js` for smoothing, interpolation, and trace-math helpers
- `app-modules/analysis-helpers.js` for Noise PSD, IP3 math, and saved-result shaping helpers
- `app-modules/analysis-target-helpers.js` for pane-aware analysis registry, target resolution, and unit gating
- `app-modules/range-analysis-helpers.js` for range stats, crossings, bandwidth, OBW, and channel-power math
- `app-modules/file-store-helpers.js` for trace normalization, dedupe, and file-signature helpers
- `app-modules/parser-helpers.js` for nearest-point lookup and R&S `.dat` parsing helpers
- `app-modules/marker-helpers.js` for IP3 marker-role helpers and peak/min search math
- `app-modules/derived-state-helpers.js` for derived-trace dependency cleanup helpers
- `app-modules/ui-helpers.js` for formatting, theme colors, metric rows, and saved-result item components
- `app-modules/pane-helpers.js` for pane ownership, per-pane trace filtering, and pane Y-domain helpers
- `app-modules/workspace-helpers.js` for workspace snapshot normalization, demo preset restoration, and session import/export payload helpers
- `app-modules/export-helpers.js` for chart export rendering and trace/data export package helpers
- `app-modules/app-hooks.js` for extracted React hook blocks plus helper wiring previously living in `kedgeiq.html`
- `app-modules/app-shell-components.js` for shell UI pieces such as buttons, trace rows, marker/ref-line cards, top bar, and footer components
- `app-modules/app-analysis-components.js` for the analysis card/component stack used by the right-side analysis panel
- `app-modules/app-chart-components.js` for the empty-chart state and chart workspace rendering components
- `app-modules/app-controller.js` for app orchestration, root composition, and the browser-mounted `AppRoot`

The app now has a practical raw-vs-derived trace model:

- imported files create immutable raw traces
- Trace Ops creates derived traces
- derived traces keep source-trace references plus operation metadata
- current derived operations include offset, scale, smoothing, and trace math

Current multi-pane model:

- 1 to 4 stacked panes
- shared or pane-local X navigation depending on the `Zoom All` toggle
- independent Y scaling per pane
- pane-local active trace
- pane-local reference lines by default, with optional linked lock mode
- marker and analysis actions act on the selected trace in the active pane

Current sync philosophy:

- no permanent synchronized pane cursor line
- no always-on shared vertical guide line
- future pane synchronization should prefer marker-linked sync or hover-linked readout sync when needed, not a forced global cursor

---

## Known Limitations

- Only tested with R&S `.dat` exports. Other formats may need parser adjustments
- Multi-pane is currently limited to 1 to 4 stacked panes
- Touchstone stability in v1 is 2-port only
- Oscilloscope waveform support is intentionally deferred to a later format-expansion phase
- Pane synchronization does not use a permanent shared cursor line
- Channel power is intentionally gated unless the trace unit is explicit spectral power density such as dBm/Hz or dBW/Hz
- No PWA / offline install support
- Large trace files (>10k points) may affect chart performance

## Why I Built This

I'm an EE engineer. Like most of us, I don't have time to go deep into React or the rest of the web stack. That's not what I do. But when I went looking for something simple to visualize spectrum analyzer exports and other waveform files in the browser, I couldn't find anything that fit. So I vibecoded this into existence.

Right now it's only been tested with Rohde & Schwarz `.dat` files, but the goal is to eventually open any type of waveform or instrument export file, online, with no software to install.

Feel free to open issues, suggest changes, and help make this tool better. The aim is to keep it as dependency-free as possible and useful for day-to-day measurement work.
